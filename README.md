# to_do_list
To_do_list with database

Here ,I tried creating a simple to-do list where we can add the tasks and delete the tasks whenever required.
I used ejs templating to reduce redundancy.

Technology stack used:-

1)Node js for backend with express framework.
2)Ejs for templating.
3)Mongodb for saving the entries in the database with mongoose as a driver for nodejs.

We can create a route on fly and perform the same operation of adding and deleting the items/tasks.
